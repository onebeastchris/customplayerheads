My attempt to make a mod, that would allow playerheads to be dropped upon player death.
Why a mod instead of a datapack? Mods, unlike datapacks, allow for custom skin files on playerheads which are necessary in the approach here to get bedrock player skins. Code is messy, since i have no clue what i'm doing!
